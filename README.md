## Welcome

Welcome to the [light.gg](light.gg) knowledge base. The goal here is to compile simple answers to the most commonly asked questions for major features on the site, document major changes, shed some light (ahem...) on some lesser known features, and so on.

Click on any of the headings on the left to drill down into the specific features that this documentation covers. (If you're reading this from the Github project, [click here to view the docs in their pretty, properly formatted glory](https://docs.light.gg))

If you've looked through this repository and still are having trouble or things aren't clear, feel free to contact us on Twitter ([@lightdotgg](https://twitter.com/lightdotgg)) or our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/pmHRd5U)

If you find anything here that's clearly outdated or that you think is incorrect, please file an issue on [the Github project](https://github.com/afpac/lightggfaqs).
