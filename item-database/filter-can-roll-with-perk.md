# Can Roll With Perk Filter

***Deprecated***

**Attributes**

<table>
<tr><td>Filter Number</td><td>18</td></tr>
<tr><td>Allow Negation?</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
<tr><td>Visible in UI?</td><td>Yes, see below</td></tr>
</table>

**Parameters**

<table>
<tr><td>Data Type</td><td>uint</td></tr>
<tr><td>Allow List?</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
</table>

Filters items based on whether their curated or random roll includes any of the provided perk API IDs.

The Bungie API assigns a unique number to every item called a "hash". You may notice this number in item page URLs such as 

https://www.light.gg/db/items/**2429822977**/austringer/

Item Detail pages show the item hash as "API ID" in the Details section on the right.

This filter is visible in the UI as the "Can Roll w/ Perk API IDs" box under Advanced.

**This filter is deprecated in favor of the God Roll Finder**. Highly suggest building your perk setup in the God Roll Finder, then clicking "Filter This List" and adding any additional restrictions you want from there.
