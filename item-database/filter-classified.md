# Classified Filter

**Attributes**

<table>
<tr><td>Filter Number</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td>Allow Negation?</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
<tr><td>Visible in UI?</td><td>Yes, see below</td></tr>
</table>

**Parameters**

*None*

Filters items based on whether or not they are "Classified" - Bungie's term for entities that it has purposefully hidden in the API. They typically classify things such as exotics that they don't want us to know about just yet.

If this filter is present, only items that are classified will be returned. Negate the filter if you want to exclude classified items.

This filter is visible in the UI as the "Include Classified?" checkbox.
