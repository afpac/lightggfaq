# Is Weapon Perk Filter

**Attributes**

<tr><td>Filter Number</td><td>38</td></tr>
<tr><td>Allow Negation?</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
<tr><td>Visible in UI?</td><td>No</td></tr>
</table>

**Parameters**

*None*

Filters items based on whether or not they are armor perks. With the advent of Armor 2.0, this is less useful than it used to be, but it can still help you see new Exotic armor perks, for example.

If this filter is present, only items that are armor perks will be returned. Negate the filter if you want to exclude armor perks.

This filter is not visible in the UI.
