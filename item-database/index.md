# Item Database

The [Item Database](https://light.gg/db/all) is a tool designed to provide a ton of ways to search, filter, and dig into Destiny 2 item data. 

As a ton of Destiny 2 entities are "items" in the API even if they aren't something you can wear or use in game, the database is useful for more than just looking up the rolls on your favorite gun: it can help you look up quest steps, preview the new emblem that was just added, or determine the actual number of kills you need to complete an exotic catalyst.

This section of the documentation covers the Item List component of the database. If you're looking to learn more about the actual item detail pages, check out [Item Pages](../item-pages/) for more info.

### Feature Wishlist

Here are ideas we're looking into potentially adding in the future:

* Gallery mode where you can quickly swipe through just the screenshots and basic info of the items in your search result
* Fully comprehensive search that includes other D2 entities such as triumphs, legend entries, perks, etc.
* Add items to loadout calculator from a search result
