# Loadout Calculator

The [Loadout Calculator](https://light.gg/loadouts/create) is a tool intended to help the discussion around theorycrafting different builds. 

It allows you to customize your...

* Class and subclass (including path, jump, grenade, and class ability)
* Weapons (including mods, masterwork, and perks)
* Seasonal Artifact (and the mods it grants)
* Armor (including element, energy level, mods and stats)

The calculator attempts to give a blank slate for you to be able to play with perks/mods, see the effects they have on your gear, and come up with your ideal loadout for a given situation without necessarily having to have the items in-game yet. Wherever possible, the calculator shows you the full effect of all of your selections, meaning if you select Backup Mag as your mod, the Magazine stat will update to show the actual number of bullets gained. 

Your loadouts can then be shared so that others can then chime in on what they think. They can play with your loadout in their own sandbox, send it back, and so on.
