# Loadout Calculator

## Subclass Inspector

The subclass inspector allows you to specify which subclass (if any) your loadout applies to.

Furthermore, it allows you to specify which abilities you want to specify your loadout is designed for. 

Summon the Subclass Inspector by clicking a class icon or the subclass diamond in the loadout summary. From there:

* If your loadout is designed for a specific subclass, select that icon at the top of the inspector
* If it isn't, select the asterisk (*)
* Select any subclass path, jump, grenade, or class ability node that you want to specify your loadout is designed for. 
* You can deselect any node to indicate your loadout is flexible for that component of the build.
